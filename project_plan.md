# **Project Blueprint: IMedical Information Extraction System**
## Project Overview 
This project focuses on extracting and summarizing key medical information from unstructured clinical documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system aims to improve the efficiency of handling medical data for healthcare professionals.

## Project Goals
Develop an NLP-based system for medical information extraction.

Automate summarization of clinical documents.

Improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical data processing.

Ensure data privacy and compliance with medical regulations.

Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD to automate testing and deployment.

Use DVC for data versioning and management.

Use MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.


## Project Scope 
The project will be structured into four phases:

1.  Data collection & preprocessing  
2.  Model training & evaluation  
3. Deployment & integration
