# **Medical Information Extraction System**  

##  **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on extracting and summarizing key medical information from unstructured clinical documents using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The system aims to improve the efficiency of handling medical data for healthcare professionals.  

##  **Objectives**  
- Develop an **NLP-based system** for medical information extraction.  
- Automate **summarization** of clinical documents.  
- Improve the **accuracy** and **efficiency** of medical data processing.  
- Ensure **data privacy** and compliance with medical regulations.  

##  **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SpaCy)  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Machine Learning (ML) models for text summarization**  
- **ClickUp / GitHub Projects** (for task management)
